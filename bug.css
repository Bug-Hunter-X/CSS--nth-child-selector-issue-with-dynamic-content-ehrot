The CSS rule `:nth-child(n)` can lead to unexpected results when combined with dynamic content or changes to the DOM.  For example, if you use `:nth-child(odd)` to style every other element, and then add or remove elements, the styling may not update correctly.  This is because `:nth-child` is evaluated based on the element's position within its parent at the time the CSS is applied, not dynamically.
